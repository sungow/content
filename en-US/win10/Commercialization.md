#MICROSOFT COMMERCIAL TERMS OF USE FOR WINDOWS 10 IoT CORE 

This is an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) (“MS”) that applies to the individual, organization or company (our “customers”) that uses Windows 10 IoT Core software for commercial purposes and describes your rights and the conditions upon which you may use the software for that purpose.   For purposes of this agreement, “commercial purposes” include, but are not limited to, running business operations, licensing, leasing, or selling the software, distributing the software in an Embedded System to customers for evaluation purposes, distributing the software for use with commercial products, using the software in the creation or use of commercial products or any other activity for which purpose is to procure a commercial gain to you or others. 

We encourage you to review the entire agreement, including the Windows 10 IoT Core End User License Agreement, and the Microsoft Privacy Statement (see Section 13 below) because all of the terms are important and together create this agreement that applies to you (collectively the “Agreement”). You can review linked terms by pasting the forward link into a browser window.  By using the software for commercial purposes, you accept and agree to all of these terms, and consent to the transmission of certain information during your use of the software as per the Microsoft Privacy Statement. If you do not accept and comply with these terms, you may not use the software for commercial purposes. 

All capitalized terms in this agreement have the meaning ascribed to that term in Section 11 (Definitions). All references to “you” or “your” in this agreement are to our customers of this Product.
